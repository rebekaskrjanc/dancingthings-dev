## Speed testing in Chrome and Firefox

| Views :                        |     Firefox   |  Chrome |
| -------------------------------|:-------------:| -------:|
| home                           | 273ms         |  589ms  |
| members                        | 251ms         |   521ms |
| groups                         | 262ms         |  453ms  |
| my profile                     | 245ms         |   572ms |
| registracija                   | 260ms         |  1270ms |
| prijava                        | 187ms         |   432ms |

Chrome needed significantly more time to load registration view beacuse of all the files it needed to load to make reCaptcha work. While Firefox also had to load reCaptcha related files, it did it much faster. The homepage was loaded the slowest in firefox but only slightly. With all the scripts and other files that are required to load to make all the views work, the home view had to make the most GET requests to get all the data from the database.
